# Midadium

This project presents an innovative Educational Management Platform designed specifically for
schools. The platform allows teachers to upload lesson videos and fill out structured
forms detailing the lesson's topic and objectives. Based on this input, students can choose
how they want to engage with the lesson content by converting it into various interactive
formats such as flashcards, interactive games, summaries, or worksheets.
The platform aims to personalize learning experiences by giving students the flexibility to
choose their preferred study format, thus improving engagement and knowledge
retention. Additionally, it supports teachers by providing a structured approach to lesson
planning and content delivery.
